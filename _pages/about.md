I am a third-year PhD student at Boston University's [Security and Cryptography](https://www.bu.edu/cs/groups/busec/) and [Theory](https://www.bu.edu/tcs/) groups. I am advised by [Ran Canetti](https://www.bu.edu/cs/profiles/ran-canetti/) and [Mayank Varia](https://www.mvaria.com/).

I am broadly interested in Cryptography and Computational Complexity. Currently, I mostly work on metacomplexity, non-interactive cryptographic protocols, and foundations of cryptography. Prior to my PhD, my research was more applied; I spent a considerable amount of time thinking about coercion-resistant e-voting and federated learning over encrypted data. 

Before coming to BU, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at MIT, where I obtained my Bachelor's and MEng.
