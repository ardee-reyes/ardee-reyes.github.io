I am a first-year PhD student at Boston University, where I am part of the [Security and Gryptography Group](https://www.bu.edu/cs/groups/busec/) as well as the [Theory Group](https://www.bu.edu/tcs/). I currently work with (and am grateful to receive extremely valuable mentorship from) Profs. [Mayank Varia](https://www.mvaria.com/) and [Leonid Reyzin](https://www.cs.bu.edu/~reyzin/).

Generally, I am intrigued by problems in Cryptography, Computational Complexity and Privacy-Preserving Technology. More specifically, my recent projects have focused on lightweight MPC techniques, moderately hard problems that can be used to secure blockchains, and meta-complexity. In the past, I have spent some considerable time thinking about coercion-resistant e-voting as well as federated learning on encrypted data.

Prior to my PhD, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at MIT, where I obtained my Bachelor's and MEng.
